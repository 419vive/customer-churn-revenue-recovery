## ðŸŽ¯ 3-Minute Video Structure

### Scene 1: Hook & Problem (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Show professional headshot or company website]**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name]. What if I told you that 17% of your customers generate 30% of your revenue, but most companies can't identify who they are? 
> 
> I built an analytics platform that not only identifies these high-value customers but also reveals over $50,000 in at-risk customer value and provides specific strategies to win them back."

**[Transition: Screen to project dashboard]**

### Scene 2: Solution Overview (45 seconds) 
**[Screen: Dashboard Overview tab with metrics visible]**
> "This is my customer analytics platform built with real Brazilian e-commerce data from Olist. Let me show you what makes it special.
>
> **[Point to key metrics]** These aren't just numbers - every insight connects to specific business actions. 287 customers analyzed, $940 average customer value, and concrete strategies for each segment."

**[Screen: Click through tabs quickly]**
> "The platform has 5 interactive modules: business overview, retention analysis, customer segmentation, lifetime value modeling, and executive insights. What makes this different is that every technical chart includes plain-English explanations."

### Scene 3: Key Insights Demo (90 seconds)

#### RFM Analysis (30 seconds)
**[Screen: RFM Analysis tab, scatter plot visible]**
> **[Point to Champions segment]** "Here's the magic - this scatter plot shows customer segments. Champions in the top-right are only 17% of customers but generate 30% of revenue. 
>
> **[Click on segment details]** But here's what most analytics tools miss - specific action plans. Champions get VIP programs, At-Risk customers get win-back campaigns, and each strategy includes success rates and budget estimates."

#### Cohort Analysis (30 seconds)  
**[Screen: Cohort Analysis tab, heatmap visible]**
> **[Point to retention patterns]** "This retention heatmap reveals customer lifecycle patterns. Green shows strong retention, red shows drop-off. 
>
> **[Point to business explanation section]** The platform identified $50,000 in at-risk customer value. With a 25% success rate on win-back campaigns, that's $12,600 in immediate recoverable revenue."

#### LTV Analysis (30 seconds)
**[Screen: LTV Analysis tab, distribution chart]**  
> **[Point to value distribution]** "The lifetime value model predicts which customers are worth acquiring. High-value customers have 3x the retention rate and 5x the purchase frequency.
>
> **[Point to ROI projections]** The analysis suggests 15-25% revenue uplift through targeted acquisition and retention strategies."

### Scene 4: Technical Excellence (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Split between code editor and dashboard]**
> "Behind the dashboard is production-ready Python architecture. **[Show code structure]** Modular analytics components, comprehensive testing, and clean separation of concerns.
>
> **[Show test results or requirements.txt]** The platform handles real-world data challenges - missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats - with proper validation and error handling.
>
> **[Back to dashboard]** Most importantly, it transforms complex analytics into actionable business intelligence that any stakeholder can understand and act on."

### Scene 5: Impact & Close (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Dashboard Insights tab showing ROI projections]**
> "The results speak for themselves: $12,600 immediate win-back opportunity, 15-25% projected revenue uplift, and customer lifetime value improvements of 20-30%.
>
> This project demonstrates my ability to take raw business data and transform it into revenue-driving insights. **[Pause for emphasis]** That's the kind of impact I bring to data science roles."

**[Screen: Contact information or LinkedIn profile]**
> "Thanks for watching. You can find the code, documentation, and live demo links in my portfolio. Let's connect!"
